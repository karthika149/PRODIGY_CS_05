A Network Packet Analyzer is a tool or software that captures, analyzes, and monitors network traffic at the packet level. It allows users to inspect the data exchanged over a network to troubleshoot issues, detect anomalies, or ensure secure and efficient operations.

Key Features:
- Packet Capture: Collects data packets traveling through a network.
- Traffic Analysis: Decodes packet contents to identify protocols, source/destination addresses, and payload information.
- Troubleshooting: Helps diagnose network issues, such as latency or connectivity problems.
- Security Monitoring: Detects potential threats, unauthorized access, or unusual activity.
- Performance Optimization: Assesses network efficiency and identifies bottlenecks.

Examples:
- Tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and Microsoft Network Monitor are popular network packet analyzers. They are widely used by IT professionals, network engineers, and cybersecurity experts.
